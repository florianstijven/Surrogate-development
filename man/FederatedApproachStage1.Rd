\usage{
FederatedApproachStage1(
  Dataset,
  Surr,
  True,
  Treat,
  Trial.ID,
  Min.Treat.Size = 2,
  Alpha = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Dataset}{A data frame with the correct columns (See Data Format).}

\item{Surr}{Surrogate endpoint.}

\item{True}{True endpoint.}

\item{Treat}{Treatment indicator.}

\item{Trial.ID}{Trial indicator.}

\item{Min.Treat.Size}{The minimum number of patients in each group (control or experimental) that a
trial should contain to be included in the analysis. If the number of patients in a
group of a trial is smaller than the value specified by Min.Treat.Size, the data
of the trial are excluded from the analysis. Default 2.}

\item{Alpha}{The \eqn{\alpha}-level that is used to determine the confidence intervals around \eqn{R^2_{trial}} and \eqn{R^2_{indiv}}. Default 0.05.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "FederatedApproachStage1()" that can be used to evaluate surrogacy in the second stage model and contains the following elements:
\itemize{
\item Results.Stage.1: a data frame that contains the estimated fixed effects and the elements of \eqn{\Sigma_i}.
\item R.i: the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated fixed effects.
}
}
\description{
The function 'FederatedApproachStage1()' fits the first stage model of the two-stage federated data analysis approach to assess surrogacy.
}
\section{Model}{
The two-stage federated data analysis approach developed by XXX can be used to assess surrogacy in the meta-analytic multiple-trial setting
(Continuous-continuous case), but without the need of sharing data. Instead, each organization conducts separate analyses on their data set
using a so-called "first stage" model. The results of these analyses are then aggregated at a central analysis hub,
where the aggregated results are analyzed using a "second stage" model and the necessary metrics (\eqn{R^2_{trial}} and \eqn{R^2_{indiv}})
for the validation of the surrogate endpoint are obtained. This function fits the first stage model, where a linear model is fitted,
allowing estimation of the fixed effects.
}

\section{Data Format}{
The data frame must contain the following columns:
\itemize{
\item a column with the true endpoint
\item a column with the surrogate endpoint
\item a column with the treatment indicator: 0 or 1
\item a column with the trial indicator
\item a column with the patient indicator
}
}
