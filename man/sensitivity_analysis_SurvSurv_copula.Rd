\arguments{
\item{fitted_model}{Returned value from \code{\link[=fit_model_SurvSurv]{fit_model_SurvSurv()}}. This object
contains the estimated identifiable part of the joint distribution for the
potential outcomes.}

\item{composite}{(boolean)  If \code{composite} is \code{TRUE}, then the surrogate
endpoint is a composite of both a "pure" surrogate endpoint and the true
endpoint, e.g., progression-free survival is the minimum of time-to-progression
and time-to-death.}

\item{n_sim}{Number of replications in the \emph{sensitivity analysis}. This value
should be large enough to sufficiently explore all possible values of the
ICA. The minimally sufficient number depends to a large extent on which
inequality assumptions are subsequently imposed (see Additional
Assumptions).}

\item{cond_ind}{Boolean.
\itemize{
\item \code{TRUE}: Assume conditional independence (see Additional Assumptions).
\item \code{FALSE} (default): Conditional independence is not assumed.
}}

\item{lower}{(numeric) Vector of length 4 that provides the lower limit,
\eqn{\boldsymbol{a} = (a_{23}, a_{13;2}, a_{24;3},
  a_{14;23})'}. Defaults to \code{c(-1, -1, -1, -1)}. If the provided lower limit
is smaller than what is allowed for a particular copula family, then the
copula family's lowest possible value is used instead.}

\item{upper}{(numeric) Vector of length 4 that provides the upper limit,
\eqn{\boldsymbol{b} = (b_{23}, b_{13;2}, b_{24;3},
  b_{14;23})'}. Defaults to \code{c(1, 1, 1, 1)}.}

\item{degrees}{(numeric) vector with copula rotation degrees. Defaults to
\code{c(0, 90, 180, 270)}. This argument is not used for the Gaussian and Frank
copulas since they already allow for positive and negative associations.}

\item{marg_association}{Boolean.
\itemize{
\item \code{TRUE}: Return marginal association measures
in each replication in terms of Spearman's rho. The proportion of harmed,
protected, never diseased, and always diseased is also returned. See also
Value.
\item \code{FALSE} (default): No additional measures are returned.
}}

\item{copula_family2}{Copula family of the other bivariate copulas. For the
possible options, see \code{loglik_copula_scale()}. The elements of
\code{copula_family2} correspond to \eqn{(c_{23}, c_{13;2}, c_{24;3}, c_{14;23})}.}

\item{n_prec}{Number of Monte-Carlo samples for the \emph{numerical approximation}
of the ICA in each replication of the sensitivity analysis.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores used in the sensitivity analysis. The
computations are computationally heavy, and this option can speed things
up considerably.}
}
\value{
A data frame is returned. Each row represents one replication in the
sensitivity analysis. The returned data frame always contains the following
columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{ICA}, \code{sp_rho}: ICA as quantified by \eqn{R^2_h(\Delta S, \Delta T)} and
\eqn{\rho_s(\Delta S, \Delta T)}.
\item \code{c23}, \code{c13_2}, \code{c24_3}, \code{c14_23}: sampled copula parameters of the
unidentifiable copulas in the D-vine copula. The parameters correspond to the
parameterization of the \code{copula_family2} copula as in the \code{copula} R-package.
\item \code{r23}, \code{r13_2}, \code{r24_3}, \code{r14_23}: sampled rotation parameters of the
unidentifiable copulas in the D-vine copula. These values are constant for
the Gaussian copula family since that copula is invariant to rotations.
}

The returned data frame also contains the following columns when \code{get_marg_tau}
is \code{TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{sp_s0s1}, \code{sp_s0t0}, \code{sp_s0t1}, \code{sp_s1t0}, \code{sp_s1t1}, \code{sp_t0t1}:
Spearman's \eqn{\rho} between the corresponding potential outcomes. Note that
these associations refer to the potential time-to-composite events and/or
time-to-true endpoint event. In contrary, the estimated association
parameters from \code{\link[=fit_model_SurvSurv]{fit_model_SurvSurv()}} refer to associations between the
time-to-surrogate event and time-to true endpoint event. Also note that
\code{sp_s1t1} is constant whereas \code{sp_s0t0} is not. This is a particularity of
the MC procedure to calculate both measures and thus not a bug.
\item \code{prop_harmed}, \code{prop_protected}, \code{prop_always}, \code{prop_never}: proportions
of the corresponding population strata in each replication. These are defined
in Nevo and Gorfine (2022).
}

\description{
The \code{\link[=sensitivity_analysis_SurvSurv_copula]{sensitivity_analysis_SurvSurv_copula()}} function performs the sensitivity analysis
for the individual causal association (ICA) as described by Stijven et
al. (2022).
}
\section{Quantifying Surrogacy}{
In the causal-inference framework to evaluate surrogate endpoints, the ICA is
the measure of primary interest. This measure quantifies the association
between the individual causal treatment effects on the surrogate (\eqn{\Delta
S}) and on the true endpoint (\eqn{\Delta T}). Stijven et al. (2022) proposed
to quantify this association through the squared informational coefficient of
correlation (SICC or \eqn{R^2_H}), which is based on information-theoretic
principles. Indeed, \eqn{R^2_H} is a transformation of the mutual information
between \eqn{\Delta S} and \eqn{\Delta T}, \deqn{R^2_H = 1 - e^{-2 \cdot
I(\Delta S; \Delta T)}.} By token of that transformation, \eqn{R^2_H} is
restricted to the unit interval where 0 indicates independence, and 1 a
functional relationship between \eqn{\Delta S} and \eqn{\Delta T}. The mutual
information is returned by \code{\link[=sensitivity_analysis_SurvSurv_copula]{sensitivity_analysis_SurvSurv_copula()}} if a non-zero value is
specified for \code{minfo_prec} (see Arguments).

The association between \eqn{\Delta S} and \eqn{\Delta T} can also be
quantified by Spearman's \eqn{\rho} (or Kendall's \eqn{\tau}). This quantity
requires appreciably less computing time than the mutual information. This
quantity is therefore always returned for every replication of the
sensitivity analysis.
}

\section{Sensitivity Analysis}{
Because \eqn{S_0} and \eqn{S_1} are never simultaneously observed in the same
patient, \eqn{\Delta S} is not observable, and analogously for \eqn{\Delta
T}. Consequently, the ICA is unidentifiable. This is solved by considering a
(partly identifiable) model for the full vector of potential outcomes,
\eqn{(T_0, S_0, S_1, T_1)'}. The identifiable parameters are estimated. The
unidentifiable parameters are sampled from their parameters space in each
replication of a sensitivity analysis. If the number of replications
(\code{n_sim}) is sufficiently large, the entire parameter space for the
unidentifiable parameters will be explored/sampled. In each replication, all
model parameters are "known" (either estimated or sampled). Consequently, the
ICA can be computed in each replication of the sensitivity analysis.

The sensitivity analysis thus results in a set of values for the ICA. This
set can be interpreted as \emph{all values for the ICA that are compatible with
the observed data}. However, the range of this set is often quite broad; this
means there remains too much uncertainty to make judgements regarding the
worth of the surrogate. To address this unwieldy uncertainty, additional
assumptions can be used that restrict the parameter space of the
unidentifiable parameters. This in turn reduces the uncertainty regarding the
ICA.
}

\section{Additional Assumptions}{
There are two possible types of assumptions that restrict the parameter space
of the unidentifiable parameters: (i) \emph{equality} type of assumptions, and
(ii) \emph{inequality} type of assumptions. These are discussed in turn in the
next two paragraphs.

The equality assumptions have to be incorporated into the sensitivity
analysis itself. Only one type of equality assumption has been implemented;
this is the conditional independence assumption which can be specified
through the \code{cond_ind} argument:
\deqn{\tilde{S}_0 \perp T_1 | \tilde{S}_1 \; \text{and} \;
\tilde{S}_1 \perp T_0 | \tilde{S}_0 .} This can informally be
interpreted as ``what the control treatment does to the surrogate does not
provide information on the true endpoint under experimental treatment if we
already know what the experimental treatment does to the surrogate", and
analogously when control and experimental treatment are interchanged. Note
that \eqn{\tilde{S}_z} refers to either the actual potential surrogate
outcome, or a latent version. This depends on the content of \code{fitted_model}.

The inequality type of assumptions have to be imposed on the data frame that
is returned by the current function; those assumptions are thus imposed
\emph{after} running the sensitivity analysis. If \code{marginal_association} is set to
\code{TRUE}, the returned data frame contains additional unverifiable quantities
that differ across replications of the sensitivity analysis: (i) the
unconditional Spearman's \eqn{\rho} for all pairs of (observable/non-latent)
potential outcomes, and (ii) the proportions of the population strata as
defined by Nevo and Gorfine (2022) if semi-competing risks are present. More
details on the interpretation and use of these assumptions can be found in
Stijven et al. (2022).
