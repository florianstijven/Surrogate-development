\value{
\itemize{
\item Total.Num.Matrices: An object of class numeric that contains the total number of matrices that can be formed as based on the user-specified correlations in the function call.
\item Pos.Def: A data.frame that contains the positive definite matrices that can be formed based on the user-specified correlations. These matrices are used to compute the vector of the \eqn{\rho_{\Delta}} values.
\item rho: A scalar or vector that contains the individual causal association \eqn{\rho_{\Delta}}
\item ICA: A scalar or vector that contains the individual causal association \eqn{\rho_{\Delta}^2=ICA}
\item ICA_alpha: A scalar or vector that contains the individual causal association \eqn{ICA_{\alpha}}
\item Sigmas: A data.frame that contains the \eqn{\sigma_{\Delta T}} and \eqn{\sigma_{\Delta S}}

\description{
The function \code{\link[=ICA_alpha_ContCont]{ICA_alpha_ContCont()}} is a set of metrics to evaluate surrogacy. ICA_alpha have the similar
mathematical properties with \code{\link[=ICA.ContCont]{ICA.ContCont()}}.
